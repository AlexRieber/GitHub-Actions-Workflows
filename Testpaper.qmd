# Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

# Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

This format hide chunks by default, but you can set `echo` option to `true` locally in the chunk:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| label: tbl-glm
#| tbl-cap: "A table."

# install.packages("broom")
# install.packages("kableExtra")
data("quine", package = "MASS")
m_pois <- glm(Days ~ (Eth + Sex + Age + Lrn)^2, data = quine, family = poisson)
kableExtra::kable_styling(
  kableExtra::kbl(broom::tidy(m_pois))
)
```
